  <summary>Summary</summary>
    <p>
      Utilizing Python 3.11.9 and code adapted from the "Preprocessing and clustering 3k PBMCs (legacy workflow)" tutorial, I analyzed scRNA-seq data from healthy mouse liver tissue obtained from GEO Sample GSM4041174, which was stored on a server. After preprocessing, including QC and normalization, I performed PCA and clustering using the Leiden algorithm. Marker genes for each cluster were identified using statistical tests, and descriptive names were assigned based on information from the "Mouse Genome Informatics" database. Subsequently, appropriate group or cluster names were assigned based on the genes in each group. The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook within Visual Studio Code, and the data originated from 10X Genomics Single cell 3' gene expression V2 sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument.
